# Project Plan for Mapping Competence Needs in the Labor Market  
**Focus: Higher Vocational Education (HVE / Yrkeshögskola)**

---

## 1. Introduction  
This project investigates future competence needs in the Swedish labor market with the goal of supporting Higher Vocational Education (HVE) institutions in developing relevant and future-proof educational programs.

The study focuses on IT and technology-driven professions, including development, cybersecurity, cloud engineering, AI/ML, data engineering, data analysis, and other roles where digital competence is central.

The purpose is to collect, analyze, and present data showing:  
- Which competencies are increasing, stable, or decreasing  
- How roles are evolving or emerging  
- What skills companies struggle to find in the labor market  

The results aim to provide both HVE institutions and the Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education (MYH) with a clear, updated, and evidence-based picture of competence needs.

## 2. Project Goals  

### 2.1 Overall Goals  
- Build a comprehensive, data-driven overview of future competence needs.  
- Produce recommendations for HVE institutions on which programs to develop, expand, adjust, or phase out.

### 2.2 Sub-goals  
- Establish a structured data collection model.  
- Create forms for recruiters, companies, public institutions, and professionals.  
- Map existing HVE programs in IT (and potentially other sectors).  
- Clean, process, and analyze collected data.  
- Produce a final recommendation report.

## 3. Project Scope  
The project is divided into four main components:

1. **Feasibility Study & Scoping** — Determine industries, roles, and tech areas.  
2. **Data Collection** — Engage companies, recruiters, and professionals.  
3. **Data Management & Analysis** — Store, clean, analyze, and interpret data.  
4. **Reporting & Presentation** — Deliver insights to HVE institutions.

---

## 4. Feasibility Study  
During this phase, the project establishes its analytical framework.

### Identify Key Industries  
- IT  
- AI / Machine Learning  
- Industry 4.0  
- Cybersecurity  
- Cloud & DevOps  

### Identify Target Roles  
Examples include:  
- Data Engineer  
- Data Analyst  
- AI Developer  
- Front-End Developer  
- System Developer  
- Operations Technician  

### Map HVE Programs  
Identify which YH schools offer programs related to the target industries and roles.

**Output:**  
A defined list of programs, industries, and roles included in the study.

## 5. Data Collection Process  

### 5.1 Target Groups  
- Recruiters (internal and external)  
- Employers across relevant industries  
- Professionals (junior to senior)  
- Industry organizations  

### 5.2 Data Collection Methods  
Data will be gathered through three channels:

1. **Forms** – Structured questions about competence needs  
2. **Interviews** – Qualitative insights from professionals and companies  
3. **Public Data** – Statistics from Arbetsförmedlingen, industry reports, SCB  

### 5.3 Sample Form Structure  

**Basic Information**  
- Name, Role, Company, Industry, Contact details  

**Competence Needs**  
- Roles needed in the next 1–5 years  
- Roles with increasing / stable / decreasing demand  
- Ranking of key technical skills (Python, AI, Cloud, DevOps, Security, etc.)

**Risk Assessment / Phasing Out**  
- Roles expected to decline  
- Reasons (automation, AI, organizational changes)

**Open Questions**  
- Competencies that are difficult to find in the current labor market  

### 5.4 Tools for Data Collection  
- **Microsoft Forms** — Survey creation and response management  
- **Microsoft Excel** — Organizing raw data  
- **OneDrive** — Centralized storage for project files  
- **SharePoint (optional)** — For more advanced file management needs  

These tools provide a reliable, accessible, and cost-free ecosystem.

## 6. Data Processing  

### 6.1 Data Cleaning  
- Remove duplicates  
- Standardize industries and job titles  
- Categorize data into themes (AI, Development, Operations, Cybersecurity, etc.)

### 6.2 Quantitative Analysis  
- Visualize increasing/decreasing competence needs  
- Rank most requested skills  
- Identify early signals and trends  

### 6.3 Qualitative Analysis  
- Thematic coding of interviews  
- Extract anonymized quotes  
- Identify common patterns and repeated signals  

### 6.4 Cloud Storage  
All project data is stored in OneDrive:

- Raw survey data  
- Interview notes  
- Analysis spreadsheets  
- Draft and final reports  

This ensures version control, secure access, and simplicity.

## 7. Reporting  
The final report for HVE institutions will include:

- Overview of future competence needs  
- Proposed new education programs  
- Programs at risk of losing relevance  
- Recommendations for updating course content  
- Data visualizations and summarized findings  

---

## 8. Communication with HVE Institutions  
- Prepare and deliver presentations  
- Send summary reports  
- Hold meetings with education leaders  
- Propose new professional roles and specializations  

---

## 9. Risks & Challenges  
- Low response rate from companies  
- Complexity of analyzing qualitative responses  
- Limited time availability  
- Technical issues with data management  

---

## 10. Project Value  

### Why this analysis matters  
The project delivers high-impact value for:

### HVE Institutions  
- Evidence-based decision support  
- Signals for which programs to invest in  
- Early warnings about declining skills  
- Identification of new and evolving roles  

### MYH (National Agency)  
- Stronger basis for approving or expanding YH programs  

### Individuals (students & career changers)  
- Clear overview of future-proof professions  
- Insights into safe and high-demand roles  

Two core reasons the analysis is essential:  
1. It enables data-driven decisions for educational planning.  
2. It helps individuals navigate future job transitions.
